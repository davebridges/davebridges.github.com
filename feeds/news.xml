        <title>Keystone Symposia Talk</title>
        <description>I have accepted an invitation to give a short talk at the upcoming Keystone Symposia on <a href="https://www.keystonesymposia.org/Meetings/ViewMeetings.cfm?MeetingID=1080">Inositol Signaling in Pharmacology and Disease</a> (a joint meeting about <a href="https://www.keystonesymposia.org/Meetings/ViewMeetings.cfm?MeetingID=1081">PI3K Signaling Pathways</a>) at the Keystone Resort in Keystone, Colorado from 2010-02-13 to 2010-02-18.  For now the title of my short talk will be <strong>Endolysosomal Phosphatidylinositides and the Regulation of TORC1 Localization and Function</strong>.  As this will be the first external presentation of this work I am very excited.
